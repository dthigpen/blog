# Hello World

Not much to see just yet, hopefully more posts to come!

But while I have you here, I'll tell you a bit about my interests that may come up in posts.

## Computing

Computing is a pretty important part of my life. I've had an affinity toward building (the digital) things for most of my life. Predictably, I'm a software engineer by trade and nothing gives me more satisfaction than solving problems with code! My side projects are usually anything from web apps to ESP32 trinkets.

## Sustainability

More recently I've started trying to live a more sustainable life. It's been exciting making those changes and I look forward to learning more. One idea that I want to explore more deeply is [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/). I love the idea of making our digital footprint less wasteful and more intentional.

## Nature

During the warmer months I enjoy hiking and camping in the great outdoors. Nothing beats stepping away from technology completely and taking in the undescribable beauty of nature!
