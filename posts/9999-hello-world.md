# Hello World

Not much to see here, just the first post on this blog. Hopefully more posts will come!

## Blog Tech

I have a tendency to obssess over niche frameworks and new programming languages, so this will likely change over time but currently this blog is created with [bic](https://bic.sh), a lightweight static site generator written in Bash with very few dependencies. It supports posts and pages written in markdown, along with a ton of customizability. I plan on exploring some of those customizations as I post on this blog.

Enjoy!
